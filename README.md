AutoRedL is an embedded AI system designed to automatically detect and track human targets using computer vision, with a laser pointer that continuously follows the detected person. The system is built around the Orange Pi Zero 3 single-board computer and features a two-degree-of-freedom gimbal for precise laser positioning.
